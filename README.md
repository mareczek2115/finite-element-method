# FEM Thermal Simulation

## Description

This project simulates 2D heat transfer using the Finite Element Method (FEM). It calculates heat distribution across a grid of elements and applies boundary conditions.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- NumPy

## How to Run

1. Prepare an input file with node, element, and boundary data.
   There are some example .txt files in the repository.
2. Run the script:

```bash
python main.py <input_file>
```
